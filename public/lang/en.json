They charge head-on into danger, throwing the enemy into disarray and giving the rest of the Legion the chance to advance. Founded long ago by a seasoned Zemyati woman nicknamed the “Bloody Wolf,” they are known for volunteering to go where battle is the toughest."

The squad was comissioned after a handful of Legionnaires held a town against a vastly superior force, surviving on rats and shoe-leather. Their leader afterwards requested his own command. They are often sent on missions where the line absolutely cannot fall, or hard choices must be made."
